/*
1.in each class there will be a default constructor.
2.default constructor kept  by complier itself at the time of compilation
3.deafult constuctor  would be no args argument constructor.
4. in the default constructor body there would be no statements. i.e it an empty  consturctor.
5.constructors are going when we are creating the objects.
