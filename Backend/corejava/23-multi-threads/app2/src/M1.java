 * always advisable to share one object to more threads
 * if we share one object to more threads then the object
   usage will be increasing
 * but if more threads access one object at a time simultaneously
   data corruption will occur.
 * if multiple thread access the same object simultaneously
   object scope will increase but data corruption happens
   that is why we should not allow simultaneously accessing
   one object by multiple threads.
   that is why we use synchronization to avoid access on the same resource 
   by multiple threads.
   we can achieve synchronization by synchronize keyword.
* synchronized keyword avoiding multiple threads accessing one object simultaneously.

* same shared object more than one synchronized method cannot execute simultaneously.
* on any of the object more than one synchronized method will not be executing.
* there is a concept called object lock. whenever any object creating for any class
  object lock is created. while creating object to shared class one lock is created, while 
  creating another object to shared class again lock is created.
  thread has to take the lock then only it is eligible to enter the synchronized method.
  
* synchronized is the object wise.
