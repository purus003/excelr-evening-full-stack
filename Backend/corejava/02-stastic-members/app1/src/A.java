3. static means something that doesnt change very often.
4. static members are also called as class members.

	how static members are processed?
	---------------------------------
	1. All the static members gets loaded whenever the class is loading to the memory.
	2. In case of static variables they are going to be loaded with their default values Ex: int ==> 0, float, double ==> 0.0, boolean ==> false, String ==> null etc... 
	3. After all the static members gets loaded to the memory, the next step is that all the static members gets initialized and executed from top to bottom only once.
	4. All the static members gets loaded, initialized and executed from top to bottom only once for one execution when the class is loading to the memory.
	5. After all the static members gets loaded, initialized and executed from top to bottom control comes to the main method. starts execution from the main method.

Interview Question ==> Is there any possibility of executing something before the execution of main method??
Ans: Yes. All the static members gets loaded, initialized and executed before the execution of main method.
