/*
We can use File Writer Object to write characters(text data) to the file

constructors:

1. FileWriter fw = nw FileWriter(String name);
2. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f);

The above 2 constructors meant for overriding existing data
instead of overriding, if we want to perform append operation then we have to use the following two constructors

1. FileWriter fw = nw FileWriter(String name, boolean append);
2. FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f, boolean append);

Note: if the specified File is not already available then all the above constructors will create that file.

Methods of FileWriter class:

1. write(int ch) - to write a single character to the file

2. write(char[] ch) - to write an array of characters to the file

3. write(String s) - to write a String to the file.

4. flush() - to give the guarantee that total data including last character written properly to the file

5 close()
